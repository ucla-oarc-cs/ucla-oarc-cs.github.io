# Virtual Memory Size of Launching RStudio on Hoffman2 Cluster

2020-06-11


We report that the virtual memory size of launching RStudio (version 1.1.456)
is approximately 2.3GB (gigabytes) *without* loading any user data on
Hoffman2 Cluster's compute nodes.
This is compared to RStudio version 0.98, which consumes approximately 1.6GB of virtual memory at launch time.
The implication is that a job will have to
request at least this much memory in order to launch RStudio successfully.

We launched RStudio 1.1.456 distributed by Anaconda using the following
commands:

```
$ source /u/local/Modules/default/init/bash
$ module load anaconda3/2019.03
$ source $CONDA_DIR/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
$ conda activate rstudio
$ rstudio
```

The virtual memory size reading was from the `top` command. We have tested
Rstudio on various CPU models, including Intel Gold (Skylake), Intel E5-2670
and AMD-6136. The virtual memory size was approximately the same across
different CPU models.
